FnulFS
* Copy file data into its own array, and when done manipulating, write it back to the FS blocks.

FnulFS treats all files as text files.

First block data [512 byte]:
    * Name [32 byte]
    * Block count [1 byte]
    * Flags [1 byte]
    * Next block [1 byte]
    * Previous block [1 byte]
    * Byte count [2 byte]
    * Data [474 byte]
Arbitrary block data [512 byte]:
    * Next block [1 byte]
    * Previous block [1 byte]
    * Byte count [2 byte]
    * Data [498 byte]

May have to add parent directory metadata to the first block of a file.

We assume that a user can find the first block when opening a file, by placing the first block of the root directory at the first memory location.

We need to know whether a block is not allocated!

Directory file data [474 byte]:
    * Parent Directory Block [1 byte]
    * File count [1 byte]
    * File list [472 byte]




Requirements:
    * Read files
    * Write files
    * Traverse filesystem
    * View directory contents
    * Associate filename with address


TODO:
    * Clarify block structure
    * Make a File, FileWriter, FileReader abstraction, no block abstraction
    * Copy file data into its own array, and when done manipulating, write it back to the FS blocks.
